# FindingShortestPathBetweenAirports
Finding the shortest path between airports problem is to discover the shortest path and the cheapest path between two airports by analyzing a few algorithms like Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford and by Simply Breadth First Search (BFS). However, because the real-world scenario is more complex than merely a graph, figuring out the best route between two locations is more difficult than determining the shortest path in a graph. 

We are looking to implement these algorithms for distinct requirements like the shortest distance path, cheapest path, and minimum number of nodes (number of stops), respectively, and understand how these are leveraged in real-world scenarios. So, the question is, how can we use these factors to optimally identify the best travel routes between any two airports?
